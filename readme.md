# Washington State Tweet Visualization

This repo contains a data visualization and a collection of tweets taken from Twitter's API.

The tweets were constrained to a lat/lon bounding box for WA state of `[-125.180036, 45.391973] and [-117.032294, 48.999294]`. Data was collected over the course of around 5 minutes.

This map shows the relative population density of Washington State. You can see the density of tweets is much higher around the Seattle and Olympia area. These are the largest cities in the state and as such contain the largest amount of Twitter activity.

An interesting note is that we got tweets on the islands off the shore of Seattle. The population density is much lower than that of Seattle. I would need to do more research into the population density difference between these islands and Eastern WA in order to get a better picture of how we should expect tweets to show up.
